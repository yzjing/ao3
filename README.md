# ao3
NEW Code and dataset for the paper "Sameness Attracts, Novelty Disturbs, but Outliers Flourish in Fanfiction Online". The original repo will be archived.

## Dataset
In order to protect authors, we do not share the title, author name, or texts of the fanfiction directly. Instead, for each fandom we analyze, we share the URLs of the works we collected in the fandom. Users can refer to [this snippet](https://gist.github.com/yzjing/92f1e27b890266388cead12ef66c4a63) for downloading contents from AO3 using the URLs.
